# microseisms_LOPS
## purpose
This repository is designed to transfer old matlab codes that were used for papers such as Ardhuin (GRL 2018) "Large-Scale Forces Under Surface Gravity Waves at a Wavy
Bottom: A Mechanism for the Generation of Primary Microseisms", first focusing on primary microseisms and hum. 

This repository is not designed to be as user friendly as WMSAN (https://github.com/lystom/WMSAN) but that other package does not yet include primary microseisms.
